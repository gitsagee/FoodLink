Foodlink: A Food and Fund Donation Platform
Foodlink is a full-stack web application built on the MERN stack, designed to bridge the gap between food donors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). It provides a centralized platform to reduce food waste and combat hunger by facilitating the donation of surplus food and funds to those in need.

üéØ Problem Statement
In our communities, a significant amount of edible food from restaurants, events, and households is wasted daily, while many individuals and families face food insecurity. At the same time, NGOs working to feed the hungry often struggle with limited resources and inconsistent food supplies. Foodlink addresses this logistical and informational disconnect by creating an efficient, trustworthy, and scalable digital ecosystem.
